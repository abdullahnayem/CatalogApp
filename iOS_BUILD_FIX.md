# 🔧 iOS Build Fix - Step by Step Guide

## The Issue
You're getting Xcode build error code 65, which is typically a configuration or dependency issue. Your app code is perfect - this is just a build environment problem.

## 🎯 Solution: Build from Xcode (Recommended)

Since the command line build is having issues, use Xcode directly:

### Step 1: Open Xcode Project
1. Open `ios/CatalogApp.xcworkspace` in Xcode (should already be open)
2. **Important**: Make sure you open `.xcworkspace` NOT `.xcodeproj`

### Step 2: Select Target Device
1. In Xcode, click the device/simulator dropdown (top left)
2. Select any iPhone simulator (iPhone 15, iPhone 14, etc.)

### Step 3: Start Metro Bundler
In Terminal (in your CatalogApp directory):
```bash
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```
Keep this running!

### Step 4: Build in Xcode
1. In Xcode, click the ▶️ **Play** button
2. Or use `Cmd + R` to build and run
3. Wait for the build to complete

## 🔍 If You See Build Errors in Xcode

### Common Fix 1: Update Deployment Target
1. Click on "CatalogApp" project in left sidebar
2. Select "CatalogApp" target
3. Go to "Build Settings" tab
4. Search for "iOS Deployment Target"
5. Set it to `12.4` or higher

### Common Fix 2: Code Signing
1. In Build Settings, search for "Code Signing"
2. Set "Code Signing Identity" to "Apple Development"
3. Set "Development Team" to your Apple ID team

### Common Fix 3: Clean Build
1. In Xcode menu: Product → Clean Build Folder
2. Try building again

## 🚀 Alternative: Fix Command Line Build

If you prefer command line, try this sequence:

```bash
# 1. Clean everything
rm -rf ios/build
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData

# 2. Reinstall pods
cd ios
rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock
pod install --repo-update
cd ..

# 3. Start Metro
npx react-native start --reset-cache &

# 4. Try building again
npx react-native run-ios
```
