## 🔧 Fix iOS Build Issues

### Step 1: Clean Everything
```bash
# In the CatalogApp directory
cd ios
rm -rf build Pods Podfile.lock
cd ..
rm -rf node_modules
npm cache clean --force
```

### Step 2: Reinstall Dependencies
```bash
npm install
cd ios
pod install --repo-update
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Check Xcode Settings
1. Open `ios/CatalogApp.xcworkspace` in Xcode (NOT .xcodeproj)
2. Select CatalogApp target in left panel
3. Go to "Build Settings" tab
4. Search for "iOS Deployment Target"
5. Make sure it's set to 12.4 or higher
6. Search for "Code Signing"
7. Set "Code Signing Identity" to "Apple Development"

### Step 4: Run the App
```bash
# Start Metro bundler (in one terminal)
npx react-native start --reset-cache

# Run iOS app (in another terminal)
npx react-native run-ios
```

## 📱 Alternative: Use Xcode Directly

If command line still has issues:

1. Open `ios/CatalogApp.xcworkspace` in Xcode
2. Select a simulator (iPhone 15, iPhone 14, etc.)
3. Click the ▶️ Play button to build and run
4. Make sure Metro bundler is running: `npx react-native start`

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### "xcodebuild exited with error code 65"
```bash
# Clean Xcode derived data
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
cd ios && xcodebuild clean && cd ..
```

### "Metro bundler port 8081 in use"
```bash
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

### "Unable to resolve module"
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

### "No bundle URL present"
Make sure Metro bundler is running before launching the app:
```bash
npx react-native start
```
